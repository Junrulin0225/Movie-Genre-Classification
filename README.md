#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Netflix Genre Classification**üçø!

After learning how broad NLP (Natural Language Processing) application is, what interestes me is **text/document classification**. My self learning journey on this path is to collaberate the technique I have been learning in healthcare and medical field. My ultimate goal is to leverage AI to predict disease/cancer using medical reports. 

Hence, I am currently learning classification with NLPK during the wait of job-searching to strengthen my muscles. By doing that, I choose to use the Netflix genre dataset because who doesn't love Netflix?
