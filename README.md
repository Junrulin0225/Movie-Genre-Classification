#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Netflix Genre Classification**üçø!

After learning how broad NLP (Natural Language Processing) application is, what interests me the most is **text/document classification**. 
My self-learning journey on this path is to collaborate the techniques I have been learning in the healthcare and medical field. 
My ultimate goal is to **leverage AI to predict disease/cancer using medical reports**. 

Hence, I am currently learning classification with NLPK during the wait of job-searching to strengthen my muscles. By doing that, I choose to use the Netflix genre dataset because who doesn't love Netflix?
